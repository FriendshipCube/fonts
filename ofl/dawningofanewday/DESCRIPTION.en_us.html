Dawning of a New Day is based on the handwriting of a friend of the principal designer.
The title was chosen by my friend, but also had great meaning to them.
They like to think of each new day as a chance to start fresh, without past mistakes.
The light, fluid motions of this script are intended to mimic that hopeful feeling.
