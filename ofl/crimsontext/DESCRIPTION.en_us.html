Crimson Text is a font family for book production in the tradition of beautiful oldstyle typefaces.
There are a lot of great libre fonts around, but the principal designer found one kind was missing:
A Garamond-inspired typeface with all the little niceties like oldstyle figures, small caps, fleurons, math characters and the like.
A beautiful workhorse.

Crimson Text is inspired by the fantastic work of people like Jan Tschichold, Robert Slimbach and Jonathan Hoefler on other Garamond-inspired typefaces.

Several important bug fixes were made in March 2022, including the harmonisation of the line-spacing across all styles.
