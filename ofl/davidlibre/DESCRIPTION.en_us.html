David Libre is a version of the David typeface, derived from original large scale technical drawings for the typeface drawn by Ismar David, and first released by Monotype in 2012.
Google worked with Monotype to release the 3 book weights (Regular, Medium and Bold) under the SIL Open Font License, and then create a new version for use by the public.
This version is intended to better meet the requirements of Israeli institutions, since David is the official font for Israeli correspondence.

Some glyphs were updated, such as the Sheqel symbol that was redesigned to be recognizable by contemporary Hebrew readers, since the today's standard form has changed from the original Sheqel symbol design.
Latin characters from the Gentium typeface were derived and integrated, to accommodate cases in which Latin and Hebrew characters will be used in tandem.
Also included are OpenType features required for diacritic marks (nikud), and Hebrew-specific uses such as alternative Hebrew-height numerals (available as Stylistic Set 1) an alternative "Hebrew ampersand" symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 2), plus the original Sheqel symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 3).
Diacritic marks have been repositioned.
Biblical cantillation marks are not supported.

Every effort was made to keep the original designs intact, and the type's original spacing is well preserved.
However, several changes have been made to fit with David Libre's goal to be used as a libre alternative to the David font commonly installed on PCs.
In order to be compatible with documents previously set in the version of David bundled with Microsoft Windows, David Hadash's glyph size has been reduced by 12.5%.
This was made to prevent cases in which documents previously typed in Microsoft's David to take up more pages and cause odd line breaks.
Please note that this does not guarantee full compatibility with that version of David, only a close approximation.
